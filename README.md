# Natural Language Processing SIG

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) SIG (formerly eHumanities SIG) of the Netherlands eScience Center is a group of researchers interested in humanities and natural language processing. We meet once every four weeks on [Thursdays (13:30)](#upcoming-meetings) to discuss progress of our projects and recent developments in the field. A list of previous meetings and their topics can be found below. At request, the meetings may be joined by external people.

Erik Tjong Kim Sang (e.tjongkimsang(at)esciencenter.nl) was SIG Lead in 2018-2022 and
Carsten Schnober (c.schnober(at)esciencecenter.nl) will be SIG Lead in 2024.
