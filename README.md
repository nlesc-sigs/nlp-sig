# Natural Language Processing SIG

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) SIG (formerly eHumanities SIG) of the Netherlands eScience Center is a group of researchers interested in humanities and natural language processing. We meet once every four weeks on [Thursdays (13:30)](#upcoming-meetings) to discuss progress of our projects and recent developments in the field. A list of previous meetings and their topics can be found below. At request, the meetings may be joined by external people.
